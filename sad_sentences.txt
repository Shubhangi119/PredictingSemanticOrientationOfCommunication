If death is a gateway to Heaven, then when God had "mercy on him," was God not being cruel by keeping him out of Heaven? Why do most do all they can to live a little longer even if it is in pain? If death is a friend, why is this friend not a welcome visitor? Why are we grief-stricken and not rejoicing when someone we love is taken by his "friend" to be with Christ and God in Heaven? How could going from this life [from pain and troubles for many] to paradise be an enemy? If death is a doorway by which we go to Heaven at the moment of death, why would a person who had lived in pain for years, do everything possible to live a little longer? Why do we mourn and not rejoice if a love one who lives in pain would go to their everlasting residence in Heaven at death where there is no pain? Is it not because we know death is an enemy, not a friend [1 Corinthians 15:26], and they are under the power of death, not in Heaven? We will not have the victory over death unto the resurrection? But, many say going to Heaven is just what happens at death, even for the Old Testament saints who died before the death of Christ, therefore before their sins were paid for by His death.
If death is a gateway to Heaven, then when God had mercy on him, was God not being cruel by keeping him out of Heaven? Why do most do all they can to live a little longer, even if it is in pain? If death is a friend, why is this friend not a welcome visitor? Why are we grief-stricken and not rejoicing when our friend takes someone we love to be with Christ and God in Heaven? How could going from this life (from pain and troubles for many) to paradise be an enemy? If death is a doorway by which we go to Heaven at the moment of death, why would a person who had lived in pain for years do everything possible to stay out of Heaven and live a little longer, even if it were in pain? Why do we mourn and not rejoice if a love one who lives in pain would go to their everlasting residence in Heaven immediately after death where there is no pain? Is it not because we know death is an enemy, not a friend (1 Corinthians 15:26), and they are under the power of death, not in Heaven; do they not by their actions demonstrate beyond any doubt that they do not believe what they profess, that death is a friend that takes there loved one to be with Christ? We will not have the victory over death unto the resurrection? But, many say going to Heaven is just what happens at death, even for the Old Testament saints who died before the death of Christ: therefore, before their sins were paid for by His death.
